# Simple project of Code Optimization
  
### What have I done?

Basically this was a VIP car page from a roleplay server that I volunteered for. 
The old webpage (old.html) was completely hardcoded (eg if we had 1000 cars to introduce into the page, we would have to write 1000x the block of code corresponding to the car).  
  
What I did was: optimize the code with PHP, making a connection with the database that would make the code automatically write the code corresponding to each car, through a for loop.  
So, when it was necessary to add a car, we just had to add the vehicle to the database and add the vehicle's photo on the server. The page does the rest automatically.
  
  
### Reinforcement: 

As I said: this project is very very simple and the main objective was to optimize/improve the server team's workflow, as constantly tinkering with web page code is neither correct nor practical.
